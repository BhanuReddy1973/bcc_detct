# Stage 2: Feature Extraction

## Overview
This stage focuses on extracting meaningful features from the preprocessed tissue patches to prepare them for model training. The feature extraction process transforms raw image patches into numerical representations that capture the essential characteristics of BCC and non-malignant tissue.

## Feature Extraction Methods

### 1. Deep Learning Features
- **ResNet50 Features**: Extracting features from pre-trained ResNet50 model
  ```python
  from torchvision.models import resnet50
  from torch import nn
  
  class FeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__()
          resnet = resnet50(pretrained=True)
          self.features = nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[:-1])
          
      def forward(self, x):
          return self.features(x)
  ```

### 2. Traditional Computer Vision Features
- **Color Features**: Mean and standard deviation of RGB channels
- **Texture Features**: GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) features
- **Shape Features**: Contour-based features from tissue masks

### 3. Hybrid Features
- Combination of deep learning and traditional features
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction

## Implementation

### 1. Feature Extraction Pipeline
```python
def extract_features(patches, method='resnet'):
    if method == 'resnet':
        return extract_resnet_features(patches)
    elif method == 'traditional':
        return extract_traditional_features(patches)
    elif method == 'hybrid':
        return extract_hybrid_features(patches)
```

### 2. Feature Normalization
```python
def normalize_features(features):
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    return scaler.fit_transform(features)
```

### 3. Feature Selection
```python
def select_features(features, labels, n_features=100):
    selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=n_features)
    return selector.fit_transform(features, labels)
```

## Quality Control

### 1. Feature Distribution Analysis
- Visualizing feature distributions
- Checking for feature correlations
- Identifying outliers

### 2. Feature Importance
- Analyzing feature importance scores
- Identifying most discriminative features
- Feature redundancy analysis

## Results

### 1. Feature Visualization
- t-SNE plots of feature space
- Feature importance heatmaps
- Class separation analysis

### 2. Performance Metrics
- Feature extraction time
- Memory usage
- Feature quality scores

## Best Practices

1. **Feature Selection**
   - Use domain knowledge to guide feature selection
   - Balance between feature quantity and quality
   - Consider computational efficiency

2. **Quality Control**
   - Regularly monitor feature distributions
   - Validate feature importance
   - Check for feature drift

3. **Optimization**
   - Cache extracted features
   - Use batch processing
   - Implement parallel processing where possible

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Stage 3: Model Training
2. Fine-tune feature extraction parameters
3. Implement additional feature types
4. Optimize feature extraction pipeline
